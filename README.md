### NBA_SportVu
Code for exploring the NBA SportVu motion data

_functions.R - Various functions that I have written.  The functions include *sportvu_convert_json* for importing motion data from a json to a data frame.  Other functions can extract distances players have traveled and create a matrix of player to player distances.

Basic_EDA.R - My working EDA analysis file.  

EDA_NBA_SportVu.Rmd - A markup document showing basic EDA on the movement data.  I published it at Rpubs, http://rpubs.com/rshah4/EDA_NBA_SportVu
